## Short description

A Warcraft 3 map where you are a deer, that has to survive in a forest full of dangers with up to 14 other players. The difficulty is increasing each day. The last survivor wins.

## Full description

You're a deer. You can't attack anyone, or build anything. You're just a deer that can only jump or graze or make weird noises. All you need to do is to stay alive longer than the other players. Surviving gets harder and harder each day - new items and friendly creatures spawn less, while predators spawn more and get new abilities.

You *can* play alone, to practice or something, but it's recommended to play with at least 1 other player.

If you die and there are players that are still alive, the map is revealed to you so you can spectate the game (or leave).
There're lots of useful tips in the Quests section, and also info about different characters you can encounter in the forest.
